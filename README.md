Script to generate the protocol messages for switching video in different matrixes

So far, Kramer and Absolute are implemented

Enter all inputs and outputs on a single line, separated by spaces.
Example:

The system uses a matrix with inputs 1, 2, and 3, and outputs 1 and 2.

Inputs:
1 2 3
Outputs:
1 2

In the case of Kramer matrices with audio extraction,
it is necessary to specify which audio outputs are being used.
